# A presentation about GIT (intro level)

This is a presentation intended for junior
developers that have not yet any experience
with GIT at all. It explains the basic concepts
using diagrams and then shows how to use the
simplest GIT commands.

I created this way back in 2013 when the CBRAIN
project switched from Subversion to GIT. The presentation
was meant to train the set of programmers that
were there at the time, working on that project.
